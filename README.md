# Task Overview
The HR platform backend is a FastAPI application structured around department routers and global JWT authentication. Following a switch to async SQLAlchemy for the employees router, endpoints for employee data began returning server errors due to event loop issues. The platform features a custom structured error handler, and only the /api/hr/employees routes are broken; other department routers remain unaffected.

# Guidance
- Investigate the async SQLAlchemy session dependency for the employees router.
- Ensure async database queries function properly within FastAPI's async context.
- Make sure the application uses the custom exception handler for structured error responses.
- Verify that endpoints respond appropriately, both for successful queries and error cases.

# Objectives
- Diagnose and correct the async database session dependency for the affected router.
- Ensure all /api/hr/employees endpoints perform properly with asynchronous DB queries.
- Confirm that error responses are structured and use the custom error handler.
- Restore full, correct operation of the employees department endpoints.

# How to Verify
- Make requests to the /api/hr/employees endpoints for listing and retrieving employees.
- Confirm successful responses contain employee data as expected.
- Test error conditions and verify error responses are structured, not generic 500 errors.
- Check that other department routers continue to function correctly.
